## Notes for Implementation

This test plan should be executed using a combination of:
- **Manual testing** for user experience scenarios
- **Unit tests** for individual components
- **Integration tests** for workflow validation
- **Mock frameworks** for error scenario simulation
- **Load testing tools** for performance validation

Each test should be documented with:
- Clear pass/fail criteria
- Expected vs. actual results
- Screenshots for UI tests
- Log excerpts for error scenarios
- Performance metrics for scalability tests

Regular execution of this test plan will ensure the HR AI Assistant maintains high quality and reliability as the codebase evolves.
